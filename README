markov_brain is a generic markov chain text generation module in python. 
It was written as an easy-to-use black box for other applications. 

Required modules:             PyYAML
Required configuration file:  markov_brain.yaml
Optional configuration var:   "past_memory": TEXT_FILE_LOCATION

An example usage can be found in test_markov_brain.py. Simply create 
a new Brain() using the "past_memory" configuration to load any previous 
knowledge. 
Adding more 'memory' is done by calling remember(words_list).
Generating text is done by calling speak_about(subject, max_chars=140).
